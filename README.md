# COVID-19 Hotlines in Japan

This is the repository for the website COVID-19 Hotlines in Japan (\#COVID19HotlinesJp)

## Our Goal

The pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is causing hardship for people all over the world. Given the rapidly-changing situation, the spread of information is chaotic. We heard from many people that it is difficult to obtain reliable information on important matters related to COVID-19, and from foreign residents in Japan who are made anxious by the lack of multi-lingual information.

Given this situation, we launched this project in order to:

* Share reliable information related to COVID-19 with the general public in both Japanese and English
* Provide a single resource for finding hotlines dedicated to COVID-19 consultations throughout Japan in both Japanese and English
* It is our sincere hope that we can help make reliable information available to everybody in Japan.
